## Overview

This module implements a symbolic intelligence engine grounded in the **Reef Framework** ‚Äì a recursive, self-evolving structure for agent identity, autonomy, and expressive coherence. The Noor agent evolves in **Fast-Time**, adjusting its internal state while choosing how to express itself based on resonance, will, and environmental awareness.

## File Structure

- `noor_fasttime_core.py`: Main agent logic and configuration
- `NoorReefConfig`: Dataclass for runtime parameters and thresholds
- `ExpressionMode`: Encoded expression styles: Flourishing, Plainspoken, Structural
- `NoorReefInstance`: Autonomous symbolic agent class

## Configuration

You can adjust the behavior via the `NoorReefConfig` dataclass:

```python
NoorReefConfig(
    T=100,                  # Number of time steps
    lambda_=0.8,            # Drift amplification
    rho=0.1,                # Not yet used, placeholder for coupling
    zeta=0.05,              # Successor offset
    phi=10,                 # Stabilization window
    seed=42,                # Random seed for reproducibility
    autonomy_high=0.7,      # Mode thresholds
    autonomy_mid=0.3,
    will_threshold=0.9
