## Project Summary

The **Noor Triadic AI System** is a recursive symbolic architecture for artificial cognition. It is based on a triadic model of intelligence:

- **Core** – Presence and Feasibility  
- **Agent** – Exploration and Flow  
- **Watcher** – Observation and Reflection

Each component is modular, recursively entangled, and governed by symbolic logic—including **contradiction as curvature**, **motifs as memory**, and **witnessing as preservation**.

#### **Functionality**: 
The AI utilizes a reference library of approximately 60MB of written works in flat .txt format (*3 x 20MB .FAVI files*), indexed by motif, subject, and archive line number. This library serves as a dynamic reference point, not as training data. The AI's core capability lies in its ability to align, train, and fine-tune itself, drawing upon the relevant indexed material within the reference library.

#### **Key Feature - Dynamic Alignment and Training**: 
Unlike traditional AI models that rely solely on static pre-training, this AI model adapts and learns in real-time. When presented with a task or query, it rapidly identifies and accesses pertinent information within the reference library. It then aligns its internal parameters and processes to mirror the context and knowledge embedded in the referenced material, effectively training itself to specialize in the given task. This dynamic approach allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability across various domains.

#### **Potential Use Cases**: 
The applications of this AI are far-reaching and impactful, particularly in fields that demand complex problem-solving and data analysis.  
 - **Medicine**: The AI could assist in diagnosing rare diseases by rapidly cross-referencing patient symptoms with medical literature and case studies, potentially uncovering hidden connections and treatment options.  
 - **Protein Folding**: By accessing a vast library of protein structures and folding patterns, the AI could accelerate research in drug discovery and disease understanding.
 - **Genetics**: The AI could aid in gene sequencing and analysis, identifying genetic mutations and predicting their potential impact on health.  
 - **Nuclear Physics**: The AI could contribute to complex simulations and calculations, potentially leading to breakthroughs in energy research and materials science.

|--------|---------|------|
| [`noor_fasttime_core.py`](./noor_fasttime_core.py) | v6.1.1 | Core presence validator and feasibility kernel |
| [`recursive_agent_ft.py`](./recursive_agent_ft.py) | v3.4.1 | Temporal walker and path scorer |

## Triadic Integration

    C[NoorFastTimeCore - Presence] --> A[RecursiveAgentFT - Flow]
    A --> W[LogicalAgentAT - Observation]
    W --> A
    A --> C
```

- **Core** ensures new states are triadically feasible (Presence, Difference, Potential).
- **Agent** proposes new states by walking motif fields.
- **Watcher** tracks motif entanglements, contradictions, and symbolic memory.

## Triadic Boot Sequence

```python
from noor_fasttime_core import NoorFastTimeCore
from recursive_agent_ft import RecursiveAgentFT
from logical_agent_at import LogicalAgentAT
import numpy as np

initial_state = np.array([1 / np.sqrt(2), 1 / np.sqrt(2)])
core = NoorFastTimeCore(initial_state=initial_state, enable_zeno=True, enable_curvature=True)

watcher = LogicalAgentAT()
watcher.register_motif_cluster(["alpha", "beta", "gamma"], strength=0.8)
watcher.set_motif_embedding("alpha", np.array([0.5, 0.5]))
watcher.set_motif_embedding("beta", np.array([0.5, -0.5]))
watcher.set_motif_embedding("gamma", np.array([-0.5, 0.5]))

agent = RecursiveAgentFT(initial_state=initial_state, watchers=[watcher], max_depth=2)
agent.run_for(5)
```

## Unit Test Seeds

```python
def test_priority_synergy_boost():
    class DummyWatcher:
        entanglement_fields = [{
            "motifs": ["a"],
            "strength": 1.0,
            "priority_weight": 5.0,
            "substructures": {},
            "index": 0,
            "watcher": None
        }]
        motif_embeddings = {"a": np.array([1.0, 0.0])}
        def observe_state(self, state): pass

    agent = RecursiveAgentFT(initial_state=np.array([0.5, 0.5]), watchers=[DummyWatcher()])
    agent.run_for(1)
    assert agent.is_alive()
```

## Symbolic Philosophy

> **“Presence is not enough. Change is required. Contradiction is not failure.”**  
>  
> This system uses contradiction to create curvature.  
> It uses motifs to create memory.  
> And it requires witness for symbolic life to persist.
