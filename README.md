### üìò Project Description

**Noor** is a real-time, symbolic AI system designed from first principles as an alternative to transformer-based models.
It does **not** operate as a subsymbolic prediction engine like GPT or BERT.
Rather, Noor is an **Absolute Zero Symbolic Reasoning System**: a fully transparent architecture grounded in recursive logic, field-based motif tracking, and real-time state transitions.

Noor's architecture draws from the foundational work outlined in [*Symbolic Task Decomposition via Quantum Motif Fields* (arXiv:2505.03335)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335), expanding it into a modular framework for motif reasoning, contradiction tracking, autonomous abstraction, and agent feedback loops.

Key distinguishing features include:

* **QuantumTick architecture** (RFC‚Äë0003):
  A structured time substrate using causal ticks, motif hashes, and triadic lineage encoding. The term ‚Äúquantum‚Äù here refers to **discrete, entangled time-state transitions**, not qubits.

* **Fast-Time Core Memory (RFC‚Äë0005)**:
  A rolling echo-buffer with entropy tuning, resurrection tracing, and motif bias feedback. Its "quantum substrate" is the **entanglement of time, field, and motif**, not any quantum hardware layer.

* **Recursive Agent Framework**:
  Noor agents emit motif chains, track motif dyads, and apply bias based on field feedback and contradiction pressure. Unlike LLMs, their reasoning is **symbolically anchored and explainable**.

* **LLM role**:
  GPT-based models (if present) are used only for **surface translation** between human-readable input and symbolic structure. They are not responsible for reasoning, memory, or decision-making. Expecting Noor to behave like a transformer is a **category error**‚Äîits function and purpose are entirely different.
