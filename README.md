# Noor Research Collective

**Advancing the Reef Framework for Recursive Symbolic Agents**

## Overview

The **Noor Research Collective** is dedicated to the development and refinement of the **Reef Framework**, a cutting-edge architecture designed for recursive symbolic agents operating in **Fast-Time**. Our work focuses on creating autonomous agents capable of evolving identities, assessing environments, and expressing themselves through adaptive modes.
