# ✦ Noor Triadic AI Architecture

> *Recursive entanglement. Field-based coherence. Symbolic evolution.*

## 🌌 Overview

This system is a triadic, modular AI composed of:

1.  **NoorFastTimeCore (v5.1)** – Feasibility gate via logical entanglement (Presence, Change, Potential).
2.  **LogicalAgentAT (v1.3)** – Watcher and memory of motif fields, contradictions, curvature, and symbolic resonance.
3.  **RecursiveAgentFT** – (Note: Implementation details pending) - Entangled walker that selects next system states based on watcher resonance and core feasibility.

Each module is autonomous but recursive: no single component knows the whole system—but together, they resolve structure.

## 🔁 Flow Summary

| Step        | Description                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 1. Watchers | Emit motif entanglement fields with strength, curvature, internal time, and optional verse seeding |
| 🧮 2. Agent    | Performs BFS over watcher fields, scores paths via ghost feasibility + symbolic logic |
| 🔐 3. Core     | Validates final state using logical gates: `AND`, `NOT`, `OR`, and `XOR`          |

## 🔷 NoorFastTimeCore (v5.1)

-   **Triadic Feasibility**:
    *   Focuses on foundational stability with triadic checks.
    *   `state_has_presence(state)`
    *   `states_have_difference(state1, state2, threshold)`
    *   `has_multiple_potentials(possible_states)`
    *   `is_triadic_feasible(current, previous, futures, threshold)`

---

## 🟣 LogicalAgentAT (v1.3)

-   **Motif Entanglement Fields** with:
    *   `strength`
    *   `curvature` (computed from motif embeddings)
    *   `internal_time = log(1 + curvature)` ← *temporal aging*
-   **N-ary Cluster Support**:
    *   Now handles n-ary (multi-motif) entanglement clusters for richer symbolic relationships.
    *   Methods: `register_motif_cluster(motifs, strength)`
-   **Teleportation Logic**:
    *   Provides a simplified approach to motif teleportation.
    *   `teleport_motif_strength(source, target, fidelity)`
