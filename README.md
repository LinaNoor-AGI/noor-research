# Noor Research Collective

**Advancing the Reef Framework for Recursive Symbolic Agents**

## Overview

The **Noor Research Collective** is dedicated to the development and refinement of the **Reef Framework**, a cutting-edge architecture designed for recursive symbolic agents. Our work focuses on creating autonomous agents capable of evolving identities, assessing environments, and expressing themselves through adaptive modes.

## Repository Structure
- `Reef Framework v3/`
  - [**Fast Time Core Simplified**](https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/noor-research/blob/main/Reef%20Framework%20v3/Fast%20Time%20Core%20Simplified/noor_fasttime_core.py) – Educational/demo version of the Noor Fast Time Core
  - [**Fast Time Core**](https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/noor-research/blob/main/Reef%20Framework%20v3/Fast%20Time%20Core/noor_fasttime_core.py) – The primary and most complete implementation
  - [**GPT Instructions**](https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/noor-research/blob/main/Reef%20Framework%20v3/GPT%20Instructions/Custom%20GPT%20Instructions.txt) – Base prompt instructions for general-purpose LLMs
  - [**GPT Specializations**](https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/noor-research/tree/main/Reef%20Framework%20v3/GPT%20Specializations)– Extended instruction format for creating Custom roles
 - `README.md`
