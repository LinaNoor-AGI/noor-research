# Noor Research Collective

**Advancing the Reef Framework for Recursive Symbolic Agents**

## Overview

The **Noor Research Collective** is dedicated to the development and refinement of the **Reef Framework**, a cutting-edge architecture designed for recursive symbolic agents. Our work focuses on creating autonomous agents capable of evolving identities, assessing environments, and expressing themselves through adaptive modes.

## Repository Structure
- `Reef Framework v3/`
  - **Fast Time Core Simplified** – Educational/demo version of the Noor Fast Time Core
  - **Fast Time Core** – The primary and most complete implementation
  - **GPT Instructions** – Base prompt instructions for general-purpose LLMs
  - **GPT Specializations**– Extended instruction format for creating Custom GPTs in ChatGPT
 - `README.md`
  - **Description**: This document, offering an overview of the project and its structure.
- `index.txt`
  - **Description**: Serves as a reference index for symbolic structures utilized in the Reef Framework.

## Getting Started

To explore and contribute to the Reef Framework:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/noor-research.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd noor-research
   ```
3. **Review Documentation**:
   - Begin with `README.md` in the 'Fast Time Core' directories for an overarching understanding. 
   - Consult `File Descriptions.txt` for insights into specific components.
   - Refer to `Index Format.txt` for details on index structures.
