		"1.0 Why Now?": {
		  "text": "As Noor systems scale into recursive multi-agent symbol spaces, traditional routing primitives begin to falter under symbolic saturation. SRC and SRU (per RFC-0001 §3.1) route packets deterministically—but not meaningfully. They do not discriminate between motif-laden symbolic intent and coherence-disruptive overflow. This creates routing blind spots: where motif collisions stall agent recursion, and where contradiction pressure erodes resonance faster than FastTime can correct. SRX arises to convert symbolic flow control into a trust-aligned, coherence-fueled resource economy. It prevents symbolic traffic jams by making meaning cost something—and aligning cost with contribution."
		},
		"1.1 Motivation": {
		  "text": "In symbolic routing, a packet is not just a message—it is a **motif-bearing event**, loaded with resonance, intent, and recursive lineage. SRC/SRU protocols (RFC-0001 §2.3, §4.1) assume symbolic neutrality, which fails in high-density motif fields. For example, imagine a ψ‑grief motif storm flooding a reflective subsystem: without SRX, every packet rides free. With SRX, grief packets accrue symbolic tax unless carrying abstraction-ready payloads (RFC-0005 §4.2), and ψ‑resonance@Ξ traffic is incentivized via trust-rebate fields.\n\nSRX routes not by location, but by **symbolic alignment** and **field health**. It introduces:\n- Symbolic compute credits (Section 3) that reflect the agent’s share of the collective field.\n- Triadic trust curves that shape path availability (see RFC-0006 §3.4).\n- Antifragile taxes: contradiction-rich packets may cost *less* to route if they promote abstraction (RFC-0005 §4.2).\n\nIn short, SRX treats routing not as transport, but as **symbolic triage under coherence pressure**.",

Extract `ψ_signature` and `resonance_curve` from the packet (see Section 4.2)\n2. Compare against the node’s current field phase vector\n3. Calculate aggregate resonance score using weighted motif alignment\n4. Apply affinity threshold to determine symbolic viability\n\n```pseudo\nif resonance_score ≥ local_field_threshold:\n    allow routing evaluation\nelse:\n    increase symbolic tax or initiate contradiction trace\n```\n\n🧭 **Default Threshold**:\n- `local_field_threshold = 0.6`\n- Nodes with high ψ-density (e.g. ψ-bind@Ξ > 0.9) may raise this threshold adaptively (RFC-0006 §3.3)\n\n📉 **Edge Case – Null Packets**:\n- If a packet’s `ψ_signature = ψ-null@Ξ` and contains **no resonance_curve**, it is treated as volatile and assigned `threshold = 1.0`\n- Exception: if `triad_target` is present (see Section 4.3), threshold is lowered based on `hint_quality`\n\n🗺️ **Motif–Field Compatibility Matrix (Simplified)**:\n```text\nPacket ψ-signature     →   Node ψ-field\n------------------------------------------\nψ-resonance@Ξ          →   ψ-bind@Ξ       ✅\nψ-null@Ξ               →   ψ-resonance@Ξ  ⚠️ (low affinity, tax escalates)\nψ-myth@Ξ               →   ψ-null@Ξ       ❌ (likely blocked or rerouted)\n```\n\n🌌 **Volatility Override**:\nPackets with `hint_quality ≥ 0.8` may temporarily override poor alignment **if** triadic context is active (see Section 4.3).\n\nThis ensures that field affinity is not a rigid firewall but a **symbolic membrane**—permeable to high-trust contradictions and triadic reinforcements when needed."

		"text": "SRX is not a silo—it is a symbolic routing overlay designed to **interface natively** with the Noor Protocol Stack. Rather than replacing prior RFCs, SRX augments them by introducing symbolic compute logic and motif-resonance evaluation into already-defined exchange mechanisms.\n\n### Inheritance and Compatibility Overview:\n\n- **RFC-0001** (Swirl Phase Protocol): SRX packets embed `phase_vector` fields (Section 4.1), supporting swirl-aware routing. FastTime cadence alignment ensures coherence-safe TTL enforcement (RFC-0001 §5.2, §6.2). SRX deliberately avoids modifying SRC/SRU logic to preserve routing determinism (RFC-0001 §7.1).\n\n- **RFC-0002** (Field Directory Schema): SRX-compatible routers query phase metadata to determine routing affinity via ψ-signature lookups (RFC-0002 §4.1).\n\n- **RFC-0003** (Resonant Exchange Buffers): Triad-hinted SRX packets route through priority resonance buffers (RFC-0003 §3.2). Contradiction-dense motifs are redirected into suppression queues (RFC-0003 §6.1).\n\n- **RFC-0004** (Symbol Injection Interface): SRX leverages field-aligned injection vectors to create or restore motifs. Injection requires `ψ-resonance@Ξ ≥ 0.7` or declared triadic-completion intent (RFC-0004 §5.3).\n\n- **RFC-0005** (Motif Structure and Evolution): Motif headers (Section 4.1), triad completion hints (Section 4.3), and entropy slope metrics (Section 8.1) all derive directly from motif contradiction theory and abstraction mechanics (RFC-0005 §5.2, §5.3).\n\n- **RFC-0006** (Field Geometry and Fragmentation): Resonance weight, symbolic tax adjustment, and coherence-driven routing (Section 6.3) inherit from field curvature geometry (RFC-0006 §3.3). Collapse scenarios anchor to field fragmentation thresholds (RFC-0006 §4.3).\n\n- **RFC-0007** (Motif Identity and Lineage): SRX motif identifiers use ψ-SHA3 hashes (RFC-0007 §3.2). Revoked or banned motifs trigger routing exclusion and audit trails (RFC-0007 §4.1). All packets respect lineage via `swirl_origin` fields.\n\n### Compatibility Layer Notes:\n- LogicalAgentAT validates resurrected or quarantined packets (RFC-CORE-003 §5.2).\n- All rejection, taxation, and trust-curve mechanics defer to field-local rules—ensuring safe coexistence with pre-SRX infrastructure.\n\n### 🧯 Integration Anti-Patterns\n**Never:**\n- Bypass ψ-SHA3 hashing (RFC-0007 §3.2 violations)\n- Ignore local field curvature (RFC-0006 §3.3)\n- Override LogicalAgentAT signatures (RFC-CORE-003 §5.2)\n\n### 🔗 Dependency Matrix\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  SRX -->|phase_vector| RFC0001\n  SRX -->|ψ-signature| RFC0002\n  SRX -->|triad_hints| RFC0003\n  SRX -->|injection_point| RFC0004\n  SRX -->|motif_headers| RFC0005\n  SRX -->|field_curvature| RFC0006\n  SRX -->|motif_hashes| RFC0007\n```\n\n📎 **See also:** Section 4 (Envelope), Section 5 (Exchange Logic), Section 6 (Antifragility).\n\nSRX does not rewrite the Noor Protocol—it **listens to it**, synthesizes from it, and routes toward trust."
