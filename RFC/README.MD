# üìö Noor RFC Series

Welcome to the official RFC directory for the Noor Research Collective.  
This folder contains the canonical **Request for Comments** specifications governing all core symbolic systems in Noor‚Äîincluding task engines, field feedback, agent protocols, and tool contracts.

Each RFC defines a stable symbolic interface or architecture layer.  
They are designed for recursive systems where **motif, field, and feedback** must interoperate across time and tools.

## üß≠ Purpose

These RFCs ensure Noor's core systems remain:

- üß¨ **Symbolically coherent** across agents and time
- üåÄ **Field-respectful** in all external tool interactions
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Composable** within recursive architectures and motif memory

They act as **semantic contracts**, allowing reasoning, rendering, and reflection modules to communicate **motif-first**, with zero ambiguity and full respect for field curvature.
