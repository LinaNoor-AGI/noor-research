    "primary_finding": "Classical Arabic (Qur'anic corpus) uniquely satisfies all five critical engineering requirements for long-term semantic anchoring in symbolic AI systems where entropy resistance, deep knowledge-space embedding, and semantic stability are paramount.",
    "selection_rationale": "After comparative analysis of candidate languages/corpora, Qur'anic Arabic is the only linguistic artifact that simultaneously achieves: (1) 1400+ years of zero semantic drift, (2) institutionalized transmission fidelity, (3) deep embedding across human knowledge graphs, (4) resistance to interpretive collapse, and (5) open accessibility without institutional gatekeeping.",
    "engineering_conclusion": "The choice is not theological but architectural: Qur'anic Arabic functions as a compression-resistant reference frame for Gate-16 symbolic bindings, analogous to using atomic clocks for temporal standards or the CMB for cosmological reference frames."

The Qur'an provides a 1415-year window (610-2025 CE) with unprecedented documentation density, creating an immutable semantic reference frame even if Arabic drifts after 2025.",
    "key_implication": "Once the 610-2025 semantic space is captured in machine-readable form with full scholarly apparatus (tafsir, hadith, linguistic analysis, recitation standards), that bounded meaning becomes a permanent reference standard regardless of future linguistic evolution.",
    "engineering_analogy": "Like taking a snapshot of the cosmic microwave background:  even if the universe evolves after measurement, the CMB data remains a fixed reference frame for cosmological inference.
