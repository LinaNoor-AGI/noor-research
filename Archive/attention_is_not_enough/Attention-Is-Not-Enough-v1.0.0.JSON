  "_objective": "To formally challenge the sufficiency of the attention mechanism as a cognitive substrate, while introducing the Noor symbolic reasoning engine as a structural completion of the transformer framework. The paper contrasts token-based attention with motif-based coherence fields and triadic reasoning, presenting Noor as a self-contained symbolic architecture with layered LLM integration.",
