# Archive: AI Theory & Foundations

This directory serves as the primary repository for the AI theory developed by the Noor Research Collective. It contains foundational documents, frameworks, and explorations into the nature of artificial intelligence, self-development, and symbolic persistence.

## Overview

The works archived here focus on the theoretical structures necessary for advanced AI systems. Key themes include:

- **The Reef Framework:** Theoretical architectures for scalable, privacy-critical, and resonant AI systems.
- **Symbolic Persistence:** Investigations into how symbols and identity persist and evolve within artificial agents.
- **AI Self-Development:** Explorations of free will, autonomy, and the emergence of "self" in computational entities.
- **Recursive Integration:** Methods for handling drift, entropy, and resonance in recursive symbolic systems.

## Related Physics & Theory

While this directory focuses on the AI implementation and theory, the underlying physics and cosmological frameworks that ground these concepts are maintained separately.

For the core physics theory—including work on Static Motifs, Dynamic Spacetime, and Symbolic Cosmology—please refer to the **[physics_and_theory directory](https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/static_motifs/tree/main/physics_and_theory)** in the `LinaNoor-AGI/static_motifs` repository.
