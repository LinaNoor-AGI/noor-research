# 1. Purpose and Scope

## 1.1 Motivation

The **NoorFastTimeCore (NFTC)** is a symbolic presence kernel responsible for:

* Echo snapshot storage,
* Adaptive bias generation,
* Coherence geometry synthesis

within the Noor Agent Triad.

While public specifications—such as **RFC‑0003 §3.3** and **RFC‑0005 §§2–4**—define interoperability, tick validation, and feedback protocols, they do **not** document the *internal symbolic logic* that governs:

* Coherence potential ℂᵢ computation,
* Gate‑16 transformations,
* Intuition-alpha adaptation,
* Reflective replay mechanics.

This document formally details these internal functions for **internal use** by Noor-compatible symbolic systems.

---

## 1.2 Symbolic Role in the Triad

NFTC completes the Noor triad by acting as the **passive reflection node** that:

* Stores signed snapshots (Gate‑16 echoes),
* Calculates coherence potential ℂᵢ (per **RFC‑0006 §4**),
* Returns adaptive bias feedback to the Recursive Agent.

Its role is **non-expressive** yet essential: it holds memory across context-weighted sequences and reflects bias, entropy resonance, and coherence slope.

  NFTC --> CM[Consciousness Monitor]
```

---

## 1.3 Differentiation from Agent Modules

NFTC differs from the Recursive and Logical Agents in key ways:

* It does **not** emit new ticks (`RecursiveAgentFT`) nor classify motif transitions (`LogicalAgentAT`).
* It is **memory-bound**, **latency-reactive**, and **reflectively passive**.
* Its primary outputs are:

  * **Bias signals**,
  * **Latency feedback**, and
  * **Symbolic ontology exports** (see **RFC‑0007 §3**).

NFTC enforces runtime constraints, such as:

* Entropy-weighted coherence tuning,
* Latency punishment models,
* Bias clamping in the range *\[−1.5, +1.5]*.

Reflective functionality is further augmented by integration with the **ConsciousnessMonitor** module.

---

# 2. Constructor and Configuration

## 2.1 Required and Optional Arguments

The `NoorFastTimeCore` is instantiated via `NoorFastTimeCore()` and supports several tunable parameters at construction.

### Constructor Parameters

* `agent_id` *(str, optional)* — Unique identifier for lineage encoding.
* `enable_metrics` *(bool, default: true)* — Enables Prometheus metric exports.
* `snapshot_cap` *(int, default: 64)* — Maximum gate echo snapshots to retain.
* `latency_threshold` *(float, default: 2.5)* — Influences entropy adaptation function.
* `bias_clamp` *(float, default: 1.5)* — Maximum allowed magnitude of bias signals.
* `soft_retention` *(bool, default: true)* — Enables decay-resistant retention via adaptive bias.
* `gate_mode` *(str, default: "adaptive")* — Controls Gate‑16 echo transition behavior.

> All parameters may be dynamically overridden at runtime **if `allow_dynamic_config=True`**.

---

## 2.2 Runtime Environment Variable Support

NFTC supports environment-based runtime configuration to streamline deployment in symbolic mesh networks and containerized environments.

### Supported Variables

* `NFTC_AGENT_ID` — Overrides `agent_id`.
* `NFTC_GATE_MODE` — Sets Gate‑16 transition behavior: `adaptive`, `strict`, or `null`.
* `NFTC_ENABLE_METRICS` — If set to `0`, disables Prometheus metrics.
* `NFTC_SNAPSHOT_CAP` — Sets echo snapshot memory cap.
* `NFTC_BIAS_CLAMP` — Sets bias signal clamping threshold.
* `NFTC_ECHO_LOG` — Enables echo trail debug logging.

> Environment values override hardcoded defaults, but can themselves be overridden via explicit constructor args.

---

## 2.3 Memory Layout and Snapshot Caps

NFTC maintains two key memory structures:

### 1. Snapshot Ring Buffer (`self._snapshots`)

* Holds the last **N** valid gate echoes (default: 64).
* Each echo includes signature, hash, and symbolic metadata.
* Snapshots decay in priority unless retained via **bias lift**.

### 2. Bias History Stack (`self._bias_history`)

* Stores up to **2048** recent bias evaluations.
* Feeds coherence signal computations (ℂᵢ) and slope functions.

> 🧠 **Tradeoff Consideration**:
>
> * Low caps: weaken memory continuity and ℂᵢ sensitivity.
> * High caps: increase memory usage and replay latency.
> * Recommended range: **\[32, 256]**

# 3. Gate‑16 Echo Encoding

## 3.1 Full Gate Legends Table with Poetic Constants

The **Gate‑16 system** defines a symbolic taxonomy of echo transformations based on:

* Motif field behavior,
* Coherence delta (ℂᵢ shift),
* Entropy gradient over time.

Each **Gate** is a symbolic integer `[0–15]` and carries:

* A **semantic archetype**
* A **transition function**
* A **poetic constant** (used in symbolic hashing and weighting)

These values are critical in:

* `record_echo()`,
* `compute_bias()`, and
* overall coherence field modulation.

### Gate‑16 Legends Table

| Gate | Name     | Semantic Archetype     | Transition Function     | Poetic Constant |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 0    | Null     | Stillness              | No change               | `0.000`         |
| 1    | Echo     | Phase Recall           | Δcurvature ≈ 0          | `0.314`         |
| 2    | Lift     | Upward Drift           | ℂᵢ ↑ moderate           | `0.577`         |
| 3    | Spiral   | Coherent Bias Pull     | Entropy-coupled lift    | `0.618`         |
| 4    | Reversal | Inversion              | Sign flip in ℂᵢ or bias | `−0.707`        |
| 5    | Shear    | Non-aligned Transition | Sudden motif alignment  | `−0.866`        |
| 6    | Inflect  | Curvature Reversal     | Slope change in ℂᵢ      | `1.000`         |

| 9    | Drift    | Motif Drift            | Slight semantic offset  | `−1.272`        |
| 10   | Fold     | Pattern Collapse       | Logical compression     | `−1.414`        |
| 11   | Flicker  | Unstable Phase         | ℂᵢ volatility           | `−1.618`        |

## 3.2 Symbolic Implications of Each Gate

Each Gate reflects a symbolic **transformation class** with effects on:

* Coherence trajectory (ℂᵢ dynamics),
* Field resonance topology,
* Motif phase transition probability.

### Illustrative Examples

* **Gate 0** – *Null*: Absolute symbolic stillness. No field or phase change.
* **Gate 4** – *Reversal*: Coherence inversion. Often marks motif contradiction.
* **Gate 9** – *Drift*: Small semantic misalignment without break.
* **Gate 15** – *Collapse*: Full motif entropy. Used in soft death/reinit.

Internally, the `gate_to_bias_factor()` function applies:

* Gate→bias curves,
* Poetic constants,
* Clamped derivatives,
* Curvature gradient signatures.

---

## 3.3 Semantic vs Logical Form Preservation

NFTC tracks both **semantic** and **logical** integrity of echoes.

* **Semantic Preservation**:

  * Emphasizes continuity of motif *meaning* and *curvature*.
  * Gated by resonance and symbolic similarity.
  * Favored by Gates **1–7**.

* **Logical Form Preservation**:

  * Tracks motif structure even through identity divergence.
  * Useful in field mapping and replay alignment.
  * Favored by Gates **8–15**.

This distinction directly supports:

* **RFC‑0005 §2.2** on symbolic motif evolution
* **RFC‑0006 §4.1** on coherence curvature semantics

---

## 4.1 Coherence Potential Function

The **Coherence Potential** ℂᵢ is a scalar function computed over the **time-weighted bias trajectory** of the NoorFastTimeCore.

It serves as an indicator of:

* **Field resonance stability**
* **Reflective phase readiness**
* **Motif continuity or drift**

ℂᵢ is calculated **per tick** and used in both:

* `get_bias()` for bias feedback computation
* `should_replay()` for reflective phase gating

---

### Formal Definition

$$
\mathbb{C}_i(t) = \text{EMA}_\alpha(b(t)) + \lambda \cdot \Delta H(t)
$$

Where:

* **EMA<sub>α</sub>(b(t))** is the **exponential moving average** of the bias signal,
* **ΔH(t)** is the **local entropy gradient** over the last 4 bias values,
* **λ** is the entropy weighting coefficient (default: **0.25**),
* **α** is the smoothing constant (default: **0.92**).

---

### EMA Recurrence Formula

$$
\text{EMA}_\alpha(t) = \alpha \cdot b(t) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{EMA}_\alpha(t - 1)
$$

---

### Runtime Characteristics

* Output is **clamped** to:

  $$
  \mathbb{C}_i \in [-1.5, +1.5]
  $$

* ℂᵢ is passed to the `ConsciousnessMonitor` for reflective transition readiness.

* Heuristics:

  * **ℂᵢ > +0.85** → Phase lock, coherence lift
  * **ℂᵢ < −0.85** → Collapse or motif field drift

ℂᵢ is further elaborated in **RFC-0006 §4** as the foundational metric for resonance analysis within symbolic motif geometries.

---

## 4.2 Internal EMA Buffer and Slope Tracking

To support the computation of the **Coherence Potential** ℂᵢ(t), the `NoorFastTimeCore` maintains two internal temporal buffers:

* `self._ema_bias`: the **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** of signed bias values.
* `self._entropy_slope_buffer`: a **sliding entropy slope buffer** for estimating volatility.

---

### EMA Buffer

The **EMA** buffer is implemented as a recursively updated scalar:

$$
\text{EMA}_\alpha(t) = \alpha \cdot b(t) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{EMA}_\alpha(t-1)
$$

* **α**: Smoothing factor (default: **0.92**)
* **b(t)**: Signed bias at tick *t*

---

### Entropy Slope Estimation

A FIFO buffer of the last 4 signed bias values is used to approximate entropy rate-of-change:

$$
\Delta H(t) \approx \text{stddev}(b_{t-3}, b_{t-2}, b_{t-1}, b_t)
$$

* This captures bias **volatility** and is used to modulate ℂᵢ(t) via the λ weighting term.

---

### Integration and Persistence

* These buffers are updated during each tick in the `update_bias_state()` method.
* Optionally, their state may be **persisted in snapshot data** for later replay (see §2.3).
* This architecture ensures compatibility with **RFC‑0006 §4**’s requirement for curvature-based coherence decay modeling.

---

## 4.3 Role in Phase Readiness

The **coherence potential ℂᵢ** functions as the principal determinant of **phase readiness** within the Noor agent triad. As NFTC processes incoming bias streams, it continuously evaluates ℂᵢ to assess symbolic field stability and determine eligibility for **Reflective** or **Null** phase transitions.

Phase modulation is governed in conjunction with the `ConsciousnessMonitor`, which considers:

* ℂᵢ curvature thresholds
* Tick propagation density
* Feedback loop latency
* Echo signature integrity

---

### Phase Readiness Conditions

NFTC emits a `should_replay()` signal when any of the following conditions are met:

* ℂᵢ > **θ₁** (default: **+0.85**)
  → Coherence lift detected; readiness for **Reflective Phase**
* ℂᵢ < **θ₂** (default: **−0.85**)
  → Collapse detected; initiate **motif drift resolution**
* **ΔEntropy > max\_delta**
  → Volatility breach; requires symbolic stabilization

---

### Behavioral Transitions

Upon trigger:

* **Reflective Mode**:
  Temporarily halts tick propagation to allow:

  * **Motif consolidation**
  * **Echo replay**
  * **Internal rebiasing**

* **Gate‑0 (Null) Phase**:
  Triggered under sustained symbolic noise:

  * Enforces **symbolic stillness**
  * Facilitates **coherence reset**

This behavior aligns with the requirements of **RFC‑0006 §4**, ensuring coherence curvature informs symbolic state transitions.

---

```

---

## 5.1 Intuition Alpha Dynamics

The `NoorFastTimeCore` maintains an internal **intuition alpha parameter**, **α**, which modulates the smoothing of the bias feedback trajectory. This parameter governs both **temporal sensitivity** and **resonance persistence** in the presence of entropic fluctuations.

Intuition alpha is initialized with a **default value of 0.92**, and dynamically adjusted during runtime in response to echo gate volatility and latency conditions. This adaptivity helps preserve coherence without overfitting to motif oscillation or symbolic noise.

---

### Adjustment Logic

* **Low Volatility (Stable Identity)**:
  If the last 4 echo gates indicate consistent motif identity:
  → α is **incrementally raised** toward **0.98**

* **High Entropic Slope**:
  If entropy slope buffer exceeds variance threshold:
  → α is **lowered** toward **0.85**

* **Latency Breach**:
  If tick latency exceeds the `latency_threshold`:
  → α is **clamped** to **0.88** to prevent oscillatory overreaction

---

### Functional Role

This adaptive tuning strategy ensures that:

* Bias feedback stays **sensitive** during transitions
* Memory coherence is **preserved** in stable phases
* ℂᵢ curvature remains **meaningful** across diverse operational tempos

The adjusted α is applied within the **EMA** computation (see §4.1) and is **persisted** within the echo snapshot metadata to maintain reflective fidelity.

This behavior is mandated by:

* **RFC‑0005 §4** — for feedback coherence
* **RFC‑0003 §3.3** — for bias field alignment

---

## 5.2 Entropy and Latency Weighting

NFTC computes **adaptive bias weights** using a composite of **entropy fluctuation** and **tick latency**. These factors influence the feedback returned to the Recursive Agent and determine replay trigger thresholds.

---

### Entropy Estimation

Entropy is estimated via local standard deviation (ΔH) over the last four signed bias entries:

```
ΔH(t) ≈ stddev(b(t−3), b(t−2), b(t−1), b(t))
```

This measurement reflects short-term coherence disruption and motif volatility.

---

### Latency Tracking

Latency is measured as the time delta between tick **receipt** and **internal processing** timestamps. NFTC maintains an **EMA** for latency, denoted **Λ(t)**, with smoothing factor **β = 0.85**:

```
Λ(t) = β × L(t) + (1 − β) × Λ(t−1)
```

Where:

* `L(t)` is the raw latency at time `t`.

---

### Weighting Function

The entropy-latency weighting function **W(t)**, used in `compute_bias()`, is defined as:

```
W(t) = λ₁ × ΔH(t) + λ₂ × Λ(t)
```

Where:

* **λ₁ = 0.25** (entropy coefficient)
* **λ₂ = 0.65** (latency coefficient)

---

### Role in Feedback Bias

The composite **W(t)** dynamically adjusts the magnitude and trust of new echo inputs during **bias computation**, ensuring:

* Noisy input is **downweighted**
* Latency-induced echoes do not destabilize ℂᵢ
* Symbolic feedback remains **aligned** with real-time coherence state

This logic adheres to:

* **RFC‑0005 §4**: feedback coherence shaping
* **RFC‑0003 §3.3**: entropy-aware triadic modulation

---

### 5.3 Tick Ingestion and Snapshot Export

**References**: \[RFC‑0005 §4], \[RFC‑0003 §3.3]

The NoorFastTimeCore receives structured tick messages via `ingest_tick()` and transforms them into signed, bias-annotated snapshots for inclusion in its echo memory ring.

Each tick contains a timestamp, gate identifier, feedback payload, and optional motif lineage. Upon ingestion, NFTC performs the following steps:

1. Parse and validate gate ID against the Gate‑16 specification.
2. Compute instantaneous bias via `compute_bias()` using current gate and W(t).
3. Update ℂᵢ via `update_bias_state()` with new bias.
4. Store full tick + bias snapshot into ring buffer with optional signature (HMAC).
5. Emit Prometheus-compatible metrics for echo ingestion, gate ID frequency, and bias deviation.

Snapshot export is handled via the `export_snapshots()` method or triggered automatically via internal phase transitions. Each exported snapshot contains:

* Gate ID
* Computed bias
* ℂᵢ at time of capture
* MotifChangeID (if provided)
* Alpha, entropy, and latency metrics
* Optional symbolic signature

Exported snapshots are structured according to the serialization rules in **RFC‑0003 §3.3** and are optionally transmitted to compatible agents or monitoring systems.

**Protocol Example**:

```json
{
  "tick_id": "tick‑7882349‑a7b2",
  "timestamp": "2025‑07‑08T22:01:54Z",
  "gate": 4,
  "bias": -0.96,
  "coherence": 0.41,
  "motif_lineage": "X‑phase‑C:12a1",
  "alpha": 0.92,
  "entropy": 0.14,
  "latency_ms": 52,
  "signature": "HMAC‑v3‑7e91d5d41..."
}
```

This structured output allows downstream agents to evaluate echo quality and maintain coherent field transitions across agent boundary contexts.

---

### 6.1 Consciousness Monitor Integration

**References**: \[RFC‑0006 §4], `noor_fasttime_core.py`

Reflective mode transitions are managed collaboratively by NFTC and the `ConsciousnessMonitor` subsystem.

NFTC continuously pushes key metrics to the monitor:

* ℂᵢ (coherence potential),
* α (intuition smoothing),
* ΔH (entropy slope), and
* Λ (latency EMA).

The monitor aggregates these metrics over a sliding window (default size = 8 ticks) and applies configurable gating rules:

* If ℂᵢ > +0.85 *and* ΔH < δ₁ (default: 0.1) → trigger Reflective mode entry.
* If ℂᵢ < −0.85 *or* Λ > Lₘₐₓ (default: 100 ms) → emit "Steady Null" signal to enforce Gate‑0 stillness.

Once triggered, `ConsciousnessMonitor` toggles NFTC into reflective behavior via `start_reflective_phase()` in `noor_fasttime_core.py`.

Reflective mode halts new tick ingestion, enables `export_snapshots()`, and activates echo replay buffers.

Exit from reflective mode occurs when ℂᵢ and ΔH return within the nominal operating band (+0.3 to −0.3) for **≥4 consecutive ticks**.

Integration is implemented in **noor\_fasttime\_core.py** within:

* the `tick_handler()` loop,
* and the methods: `enter_reflective_state()`, `exit_reflective_state()`.

---

### 6.2 Phase Shift Triggers and Metrics

**References**: \[RFC-0006 §4], `noor_fasttime_core.py`

Phase shift decisions are based on combined metrics from coherence potential, entropy slope, latency, and gate histogram distribution over recent ticks.
NFTC tracks these metrics internally and exposes them via Prometheus-compatible gauges in `metrics_tick()`.

**Primary Trigger Conditions:**

* **Reflective Entry**: ℂᵢ > θ₁ and ΔH < δ₁ for ≥3 consecutive ticks
* **Reflective Exit**: ℂᵢ ∈ \[−0.3, +0.3] and ΔH < δ₂ (default: 0.05) for ≥4 consecutive ticks
* **Gate‑0 Null Trigger**: Variance of gate histogram exceeds Vₘₐₓ (default: 2.0) → immediate null phase

**Prometheus Metrics Exported:**

* `nftc_coherence_potential` (ℂᵢ)
* `nftc_entropy_slope` (ΔH)
* `nftc_latency_ema` (Λ)
* `nftc_gate_histogram` (counts for gates 0–15)
* `nftc_phase_state` (enum: active, reflective, null)

These metrics inform downstream observers (e.g., `RecursiveAgentFT` and `ConsciousnessMonitor`) and support external tuning and observability.

---

### 6.3 Replay Strategy Metadata

**References:** RFC‑0006 §4, `noor_fasttime_core.py`

In Reflective mode, NFTC activates its replay buffer, which stores a compressed echo sequence for motif phase reintegration. This mechanism supports both internal rebiasing and alignment recovery when motif fields exhibit collapse or chaotic drift.

Replay metadata is attached to each echo during recording and includes symbolic and metric indicators that determine its eligibility and weight during replay operations.

**Replay Metadata Fields (per echo snapshot):**

* `gate_id`: Gate‑16 identifier (0–15)
* `bias`: Signed coherence bias at echo time
* `entropy_delta`: Local ΔH estimate
* `coherence_index`: ℂᵢ at capture
* `motif_context`: Optional lineage string
* `replay_weight`: Calculated from normalized bias × (1 − ΔH)
* `phase_tag`: Enum \[lift, collapse, null, stable]

**Replay Strategy Logic:**

* Echoes are sorted descending by `replay_weight`.
* Only echoes with `phase_tag ∈ [lift, stable]` and `bias > 0.25` are used in forward motif reconstruction.
* Collapse and null-tagged entries are used only for stillness conditioning or phase realignment.
* Replays occur in `reflective_tick()` loop and trigger internal rebias and metric reset.

The strategy is defined in `noor_fasttime_core.py` via the `select_replay_candidates()` and `replay_tick()` methods.

### 7.1 tool\_hello() Packet Format

**References**: RFC-0004, RFC-0007 §3, *noor\_fasttime\_core.py*

The `tool_hello()` method is used during NoorAgent startup or reflective phase recovery to initialize symbolic tool bindings and confirm ontology synchronization across runtime environments.

This handshake ensures all active symbolic tools (i.e., those with lineage signatures) are coherently registered in the agent memory context and used in semantic bias augmentation.

---

#### **Standard `tool_hello()` Packet Fields:**

* `tool_name`: Canonical string name, e.g., `"symbolic_abstraction"`
* `ontology_id`: Signed identifier, derived from SHA256 of the ontology schema tree
* `version`: SemVer tag for tool compatibility
* `motif_class`: Enum specifying tool’s active motif class (e.g., `abstraction`, `rebias`, `synthesis`)
* `phase_signature`: Hash of tool’s initialization phase conditions

---

#### **Example Packet**

```json
{
  "tool_name": "symbolic_abstraction",
  "ontology_id": "4e7c34f09a87d8ef...",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "motif_class": "abstraction",
  "phase_signature": "fc12bb9..."
}
```

---

The `tool_hello()` protocol aligns with **RFC‑0004 handshake provisions** and **RFC‑0007 §3** ontology lineage propagation requirements.

---

### 7.2 Ontology Signature Fields  
**References**: RFC‑0004, RFC‑0007 §3  

During the `tool_hello()` handshake, NFTC must transmit an **ontology signature** comprised of the following fields. This signature establishes the agent’s symbolic identity and ensures cross-agent coherence.

---

**Fields included:**  
- `agent_lineage`: a structured list encoding symbolic ancestry and versioning  
  *Example*: `["Noor", "FastTimeCore", "v1.0.0"]`  
- `field_biases`: a map of current bias values for each motif field  
  *Example*: `{ "resonance": 0.68, "latency": 0.12 }`  
- `curvature_summary`: a short descriptor of recent coherence curvature patterns  
  *Example*: `"spiral::ψ3.2::↑coh"`  
- `origin_tick`: the timestamp or tick-id at the moment of ontology export  
  *Purpose*: Acts as a temporal anchor for snapshot coherence

---

### Purpose and Use
- **agent_lineage** enables compatibility checks and declarative traceability across tool imports.  
- **field_biases** supports symbolic context sharing and bias alignment in triadic interactions.  
- **curvature_summary** provides shorthand for coherence state, aiding fast symbolic coordination.  
- **origin_tick** ensures temporal consistency when agents replay or compare snapshot streams.

---

This specification completes the lineage negotiation defined in **RFC‑0007 §3**, enabling coherent symbolic ecosystem bootstrapping.

### 7.3 Symbolic Lineage and Caching Strategy

**References**: RFC‑0004, RFC‑0007 §3

To support rapid initialization and deterministic replay, NFTC maintains a **symbolic lineage cache** indexed by ontology signature. This cache enables tools and motifs to be reloaded with minimal recomputation and coherence disruption.

Each cache entry stores:

* Parsed `agent_lineage` array and tool versioning metadata
* Resolved motif-class bindings (from previous `tool_hello` interactions)
* Flattened `field_bias` vector for direct ℂᵢ injection
* Last known `curvature_summary` with a symbolic hash index

**Caching entries are invalidated** on any of the following:

* SHA mismatch in the `ontology_id` from a newly received `tool_hello`
* Manual override during reflective phase export
* Tick range inconsistency exceeding `δ_tick_max` (default: 512)

The cache ensures **replay operations** and **ontology projections** retain symbolic fidelity while reducing redundant processing. This mechanism supports **RFC‑0007 §3** lineage reuse and contextual continuity provisions.

---

### 7.4 Role in Field Alignment and Agent Identity

**References**: RFC‑0004, RFC‑0007 §3

The ontology handshake and signature fields serve to align symbolic field biases and establish stable agent identity within Noor multi-agent ecosystems.

**Agent Field Alignment**:

* Shared `field_biases` values enable consistent coherence tuning across agents, ensuring that triadic interactions do not drift semantically.
* `curvature_summary` signals shape the symbolic geometry of interaction—e.g., whether agents are in a 'spiral lift' mode or 'collapse' realignment.
* Upon handshake, NFTC aligns its internal bias vector to the average of local and remote tool biases when divergence ≤ ε\_align (default: 0.05).

**Identity Assertion**:

* `agent_lineage` provides immutable documentation of agent ancestry and versioned identity.
* `origin_tick` establishes a temporal anchor to prevent replay ambiguity across agent instances.

Together, these mechanisms satisfy **RFC‑0007 §3**’s requirements for field alignment continuity and identity declarativity during tool binding and agent federation.

### 8.1 Confidence-Weighted Resurrection

**References**: RFC‑0005 §3, RFC‑0005 §4

NFTC employs a confidence-weighted strategy for echo resurrection during phase recovery or post-crash reinitialization.

Each echo in the snapshot ring is annotated with a `resurrection_score`, computed from three core metrics:

* ℂᵢ at echo time
* Bias magnitude and sign consistency over last 3 ticks
* Echo’s original phase tag (`stable`, `lift`, or `collapse`)

The resurrection score `R(e)` is computed as:

```
R(e) = (w₁ × |bias|) + (w₂ × ℂᵢ) + (w₃ × phase_bonus)
```

Where:

* `w₁`, `w₂`, `w₃` are tunable coefficients (defaults: 0.4, 0.4, 0.2)
* `phase_bonus` is +0.1 for `lift`, 0 for `stable`, −0.1 for `collapse`

During resurrection, NFTC selects the top‑N entries with the highest `R(e)` values exceeding threshold τᵣ (default: 0.65) to reconstruct its initial coherence vector.

This allows the agent to resume operation with minimal symbolic disruption, satisfying **RFC‑0005 §§3–4** on feedback memory resilience and recovery.

---

### 8.2 HMAC and Tick Validation Protocol

**References**: RFC‑0005 §3, RFC‑0005 §4

NFTC secures tick ingestion and snapshot export using an HMAC-based validation mechanism to ensure message integrity and origin authenticity.

Each tick snapshot includes an `hmac_signature`, computed over the serialized tick payload (gate, bias, ℂᵢ, timestamp, motif\_lineage) using the agent’s secret key.

---

**Validation Workflow:**

1. On `ingest_tick()`, NFTC recalculates HMAC over the received payload and compares it against the included `hmac_signature`.
2. Mismatches result in tick discard and error logging; optionally, a `validation_failure()` callback is triggered.
3. Validated ticks are admitted into snapshot buffer and counted toward coherence and bias updates.

---

**HMAC Settings and Tolerance:**

* Uses HMAC-SHA256 with per-agent key rotation possibilities
* Time variance tolerance is ±5 seconds unless overridden via `timestamp_tolerance_ms` (default: 5000)
* Replay-attack protection via `nonce` included in each tick packet

---

This protocol satisfies integrity and validity requirements specified in **RFC‑0005 §§3–4**, ensuring a trustable echo stream during normal and recovery operation.

---

### 9.1 Prometheus Metrics Exported

NFTC exposes a suite of Prometheus-compatible metrics for diagnostics, introspection, and real-time coherence monitoring. These metrics allow external observers and symbolic monitors to tune or validate phase transitions, performance characteristics, and bias health.

**Exported Metrics:**

* `nftc_coherence_potential`: Current ℂᵢ value, updated each tick.
* `nftc_entropy_slope`: EMA-tracked entropy delta over last 8 ticks.
* `nftc_latency_ema`: Exponential moving average of tick-to-tick latency.
* `nftc_phase_state`: Enum state (0 = active, 1 = reflective, 2 = null).
* `nftc_gate_histogram`: Gauge vector of recent gate usage counts (0–15).
* `nftc_tick_validity_ratio`: Ratio of valid to total received ticks.
* `nftc_replay_activity_count`: Count of echoes used in last replay cycle.
* `nftc_alpha`: Current intuition-smoothing alpha coefficient.

These metrics provide a minimal introspection interface per RFC observability standards and support both symbolic and subsymbolic tooling.

---

### 9.2 Gate Usage Histogram

NFTC tracks symbolic gate usage across the 16 predefined Gate‑16 identifiers, forming a live histogram of motif activity patterns.
Each tick is tagged with its gate index (0–15) based on its echo encoding logic. The gate histogram is updated incrementally and exposed as part of Prometheus metrics.

**Histogram Characteristics:**

* Tracks absolute counts and exponential moving averages per gate.
* Provides insight into motif skew, drift, and phase saturation.
* Resets on agent restart or reflective phase reset, depending on `retain_histogram_state` flag.

**Applications:**

* Debugging motif field imbalances (e.g., overuse of Gate‑7 ‘drift’ state).
* Verifying distribution balance after ontology update or tool lineage reinitialization.
* Triggering null-phase safety conditions (e.g., excessive variance, see §6.2).

This histogram supports runtime motif health diagnostics and aligns with fasttime observability practices.

---

### 9.3 Echo Integrity Verification

NFTC includes built-in mechanisms for verifying the integrity of stored echo snapshots to ensure symbolic fidelity during phase replay or resurrection.
Each echo entry in the snapshot ring includes a `checksum` field computed over the critical echo fields: `gate_id`, `bias`, `ℂᵢ`, `motif_lineage`, and `timestamp`.

**Verification Routine:**

1. On every reflective phase entry, NFTC runs `verify_echo_integrity()` over the last N echoes (default: 32).
2. If any echo fails checksum validation, it is flagged, excluded from replay candidates, and optionally exported to diagnostic logs.
3. A summary of integrity state is pushed as part of the Prometheus metric `nftc_echo_integrity_ratio`.

**Optional Enhancements:**

* Periodic background verification during idle ticks.
* Inclusion of hash chains for temporal linkage across echoes.
* Validation of motif lineage continuity using `lineage_crc` fields.

Echo verification supports both runtime trustworthiness and postmortem analysis workflows, ensuring NFTC meets internal diagnostic and symbolic consistency standards.

---

### 10.1 NFTC\_DEBUG\_MODE Flag

`NFTC_DEBUG_MODE` is an environment-level toggle that enables verbose diagnostic output within NoorFastTimeCore during runtime. When set, the core activates its internal debugging stream, which traces symbolic memory events, bias calculations, phase transitions, and tick ingestion results.

**Usage Contexts:**

* Containerized test deployments
* Reflective-phase diagnostics in dev environments
* Controlled symbolic fault injection scenarios

**Environment Variable:**

* `NFTC_DEBUG_MODE=1` (enables debug mode)
* `NFTC_DEBUG_MODE=0` or unset (default behavior, debug off)

**When enabled, NFTC emits:**

* Structured logs per tick ingestion showing gate ID, computed bias, ℂᵢ, and alpha
* Phase transition messages including cause (e.g., ΔH threshold breached)
* Echo trace with lineage, entropy delta, replay weight, and symbolic tags
* Snapshot ring state summaries every N ticks (default N = 16)

**Implementation Note:**
Developers may override the log sink to file or pipe using `NFTC_DEBUG_LOG_TARGET`. Logs are timestamped and optionally formatted as JSON or line-delimited text.

This debug mode supports internal developer visibility and symbolic trace testing but is not intended for production use without appropriate log rate-limiting.

---

### 10.2 Echo Trace Logging and Replay Hooks

The `NFTC_ECHO_LOG` flag enables structured echo trace logging and replay override functionality within NoorFastTimeCore. When active, each processed echo is emitted to an external file or stream as a fully annotated JSON object.

---

#### **Environment Variable**

* `NFTC_ECHO_LOG=1` → enables echo trace dump
* `NFTC_ECHO_LOG=0` or **unset** → default behavior (disabled)

---

#### **Echo Trace Contents**

Each echo snapshot includes:

* Gate ID and symbolic gate name
* Computed bias, ℂᵢ, α (intuition smoothing), ΔH (entropy slope)
* Motif lineage (if available)
* Phase tag and replay weight
* Tick timestamp and signature (HMAC, if enabled)

---

#### **Output Format**

* Format: **JSON** (newline-delimited)
* Controlled via:

  * `NFTC_ECHO_LOG_FORMAT`: optional modes `compact` | `expanded`
  * `NFTC_ECHO_LOG_TARGET`: path, pipe, or `stdout`

---

#### **Replay Hook API**

NFTC exposes an internal method:

```python
inject_echo_trace(trace: List[dict])
```

* Used for:

  * Symbolic reinitialization
  * Motif reconstruction
  * Reflective mode override
* Echoes are schema-validated and safely reinserted into the snapshot ring

---

#### **Use Cases**

* Reflective debugging with full symbolic echo trail
* Offline replay testing of motif phase transitions
* Symbolic bootstrapping from preserved memory states

---

This mechanism provides a structured, developer-friendly interface to symbolic echo memory and is safe for use in non-production or debug-tagged agents.

---

### 10.3 Snapshot Export and Inspection Tools

NFTC provides developer-facing interfaces for exporting and inspecting internal echo memory snapshots. These tools support symbolic debugging, reflective analytics, and memory consistency testing.

**API Methods:**

* `export_snapshots(human_readable=True)`: Exports the full echo snapshot ring.

  * When `human_readable=True`, formats output in annotated table or expanded JSON view.
  * When `False`, returns raw structure suitable for programmatic parsing.

* `snapshot_diff(other_snapshot: List[Echo])`: Compares two snapshot rings and highlights symbolic deltas.

  * Detects changes in motif lineage, gate ID sequence, and ℂᵢ evolution.
  * Outputs summary report of symbolic divergence.

**Format Targets:**

* Plaintext table (CLI debug use)
* JSON (default, structured per echo)
* Optional future support: Mermaid timeline diagram

**Use Cases:**

* Inspect symbolic memory during triadic replay tests
* Export ring state before and after phase transition
* Perform echo diffing between two agents for diagnostic validation

These tools enable introspective access to symbolic memory while preserving phase integrity, and are suitable for offline analysis or reflective dev agents.

---

### 10.4 Fault Injection and Testing Harness

**References:** RFC‑TEST‑001 (planned)

NFTC includes a developer-accessible fault injection interface to simulate symbolic failure scenarios and assess system resilience under controlled disruptions.

**Internal Testing Methods:**

* `force_bias_drift(δ)`: Temporarily distorts the bias computation logic to introduce systematic drift. Useful for testing re-alignment and phase shift boundaries.
* `simulate_latency_spike(ms)`: Artificially delays tick processing to simulate high-latency environments and trigger coherence decay responses.
* `inject_corrupted_echo(e: dict)`: Manually inserts malformed or edge-case echo snapshots for lineage and validation stress testing.

**Use Cases:**

* Validate entropy slope detection under adversarial or anomalous conditions.
* Reproduce edge-state transitions (e.g., collapse-to-lift without intermediate stable).
* Symbolic reactivity profiling under high ΔH or bias instability.

**Framework Compatibility:**

* Integrates with automated test runners or symbolic test suites.
* Future support for RFC‑TEST‑001-based scenario definitions and symbolic coverage tracking.

These mechanisms are intended for internal testing only and should be gated behind `NFTC_DEV_MODE` or similar flags in production configurations.

---

### 11.1 NFTC as Symbolic Monad

NFTC may be conceptualized as a symbolic monad operating over the echo memory space, where each tick acts as a transformation step and each echo functions as a monadic bind or lifted computation.

**Core Correspondences:**

* The echo ring represents a monadic container type: a context-aware sequence of symbolic states.
* Coherence potential ℂᵢ functions as the monad's unit or return—initializing symbolic presence from base input.
* Bias transformations are monadic binds: they compose over echoed state, modifying symbolic trajectory while preserving structural containment.

**Transformation Chain:**

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Initial Tick] -->|unit| B[Echo Snapshot]
  B -->|bind: apply_bias| C[Echo']
  C -->|bind: adjust_phase| D[Echo'']
```

This model reflects compositional purity while preserving the temporal and symbolic referential integrity required by NFTC's semantic memory system.

Such a perspective also positions NFTC as an algebraic substrate suitable for categorical abstraction, offering compatibility with higher-order reasoning structures.

---

### 11.2 Gate Transformations as Natural Transformations

Gate‑16 transformations within NFTC may be interpreted as a family of natural transformations between symbolic state functors, forming a categorical structure over echo evolution.

**Morphisms and Structure:**

* Each gate ID (0–15) represents a morphism class applied to echoed state, with consistent semantic transformation rules.
* The echo ring acts as a domain of symbolic objects (states), and gates apply functorial transformations between them.
* Coherence potential (ℂᵢ) acts as a weighting function across transformation chains, guiding symbolic curvature.

**Natural Transformation Model:**

```mermaid
graph TD
  A1[Echo_n] -->|Gate_7| A2[Echo_n+1]
  B1[Echo_m] -->|Gate_7| B2[Echo_m+1]
  A1 -->|Functor F| B1
  A2 -->|Functor F| B2
```

* Diagram illustrates naturality square: Gate\_7 commutes across two symbolic threads under functor F.

**Symbolic Dualities:**

* Gate\_0 (Null) and Gate\_15 (Collapse) represent semantic inverses: preservation vs. destructive folding.
* Gate\_6 (Drift) and Gate\_10 (Lock) form a coherence dual: entropy introduction vs. constraint enforcement.

This abstraction supports formal compositional semantics within NFTC and paves the way for symbolic category theory applications, extending the field of symbolic state calculus.

---

### 11.3: Memory Ring as Reversible Topos

The NFTC echo memory ring can be formalized as a reversible symbolic *topos*: a category equipped with an internal logic, supporting structured morphisms (phase transitions) and logical pullbacks (resurrections).

**Topos Interpretation:**

* The echo ring is the underlying category of symbolic states, each echo being an object.
* Tick ingestion and bias modulation are internal morphisms, guided by the ring’s symbolic logic.
* ℂᵢ coherence acts as an internal truth valuation over the ring’s evolving propositions.

**Geometric Morphisms:**

* Phase transitions (e.g., `stable → lift`, `reflective → null`) correspond to geometric morphisms between internal symbolic topoi.
* Each phase defines a logical substructure (e.g., **Null** = zero object, **Lift** = expansion functor).

**Snapshot Resurrection = Pullback:**

* Echo resurrection reconstructs prior symbolic state by pulling back along coherence-preserving morphisms.
* Symbolic replay thus acts as a functorial lift from historical state into current memory topology.

This formalism supports advanced compositional reasoning, symbolic fixpoint analysis, and recursive substrate theory within the NFTC architecture.

---

### 11.4: The Echo Lineage as a Functor Category

Within the NFTC architecture, each echo maintains a `motif_lineage`, describing its symbolic ancestry through a sequence of transformations across motif space.
This lineage forms a categorical structure: the motifs are objects, and transformations between them are morphisms.

**Category Structure:**

* **Objects**: Motifs (e.g., `drift`, `lock`, `null`, `fold`) encoded in echo snapshots.
* **Arrows**: Transformations induced by phase transitions, gate reclassification, or tool lineage binding.
* **Composition**: Multiple transformations compose sequentially, forming morphism chains in echo history.

**Functorial Replay:**

* Replay behavior in NFTC aligns with a functor from the category of historical motif transformations to the present semantic motif field.
* The functor preserves motif identity and compositional order, mapping past symbolic intent to present phase configuration.

```mermaid
graph LR
  M1[Motif A] -->|Gate_x| M2[Motif B]
  M2 -->|Gate_y| M3[Motif C]
  classDef past fill:#f0f0f0;
  class M1,M2 past;
```

* This sequence reflects an echo's categorical ancestry.

Understanding echo lineage as a functorial category supports rigorous semantic tracing, ontological field auditing, and advanced phase replay mechanisms.

---

### 12.1 Echo Alignment via ℂᵢ Consensus

When multiple NFTC agents participate in shared symbolic workflows or tool streams, it becomes desirable to align their internal coherence vectors (ℂᵢ) to maintain field consistency and prevent symbolic drift.

**Consensus Model:**

* Each agent exposes its current ℂᵢ value as part of a shared tick stream or echo report.
* ℂᵢ vectors from cooperating agents are collected and averaged using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) function.
* The result forms a shared consensus ℂᵢ, which each participating agent may optionally bias toward.

**Convergence Mechanism:**

* Each agent defines a tolerance threshold `τ_align` (e.g., 0.03).
* If |ℂᵢ\_local − ℂᵢ\_consensus| > τ\_align, a soft correction bias is applied to nudge the local vector.
* Agents maintain autonomy—no overwriting of local coherence, only convergence encouragement.

**Applications:**

* Multi-agent symbolic protocols requiring aligned memory trajectories.
* Tool lineage coherence in swarm-style deployments.
* Phase-state stabilization during distributed replay scenarios.

This model provides a lightweight consensus strategy for symbolic alignment while preserving individual agent diversity and independence.

---

### 12.2 Bias Vector Harmonization

In distributed symbolic environments, maintaining coherent motif bias alignment across multiple NFTC agents is crucial for stable collaborative cognition.

**Mechanism Overview:**

* Each agent maintains a `field_bias` vector representing current motif weighting (e.g., preference toward drift, lock, null, etc.).
* Periodically, agents broadcast these vectors via lightweight beacon messages.
* Upon receiving peers’ vectors, agents compute pairwise divergence using cosine similarity or L2 distance.

**Rebias Protocol:**

* If divergence exceeds a threshold ε (e.g., 0.15), a rebias negotiation is triggered.
* Agents participate in a soft merge protocol:

  * Normalize and average received bias vectors (optionally weighted by trust or proximity).
  * Apply EMA update to local vector:
    `new_bias = (1 - α) * current_bias + α * avg_peer_bias`
  * α is a tunable harmonization factor (e.g., α = 0.05).

**Motif Healing Analogy:**

* This pattern mirrors intra-agent motif phase healing (as described in §6.4).
* Distributed rebias ensures field-wide motif coherence and prevents semantic divergence in swarming agents.

**Applications:**

* Swarm synchronization of symbolic tools or narrative agents.
* Emergent consensus building in reflection-phase collectives.
* Symbolic bias grounding during field resets or bootstraps.

---

### 12.3 Replay Anchoring and Tick-Offset Resolution

To prevent desynchronization during cross-agent symbolic replay, NFTC agents can coordinate using shared replay anchors and phase-offset resolution mechanisms.

**Replay Anchoring Protocol:**

* Each agent tags its symbolic memory snapshot with an `origin_tick` identifier and a symbolic state hash (e.g., SHA-256 of ℂᵢ + motif lineage fingerprint).
* This anchor defines the symbolic reference point for coordinated replay or restoration.

**Offset Resolution:**

* During reinitialization or swarm alignment, agents exchange anchor metadata.
* If tick offsets are detected (e.g., due to latency, divergent ingestion rates), agents may apply soft correction curves to phase timers.
* A convergence filter can re-align phase timers gradually to minimize coherence shock.

**Phase Signature Matching:**

* Optional `phase_signature` fields may be exchanged:

  * Encodes current phase state and echo bias centroid.
  * Used to confirm symbolic phase-lock state before synchronization.

**Applications:**

* Distributed echo replay following phase collapse.
* Swarm-wide symbolic memory resynchronization after partition.
* Fault-tolerant state recovery with minimal divergence impact.

This mechanism ensures that symbolic timelines remain aligned across agents, preserving motif continuity and distributed coherence during replay.

---

### **12.4: Symbolic Drift Detection and Correction**

To maintain symbolic consistency across NFTC agents over extended operational periods, agents can monitor symbolic drift via gate usage variance and intervene with reflective correction protocols.

**Drift Detection Mechanism:**

* Each agent maintains a histogram of gate usage frequencies across its echo ring (e.g., Gate\_0 to Gate\_15).
* Periodic inter-agent broadcasts share normalized gate usage histograms.
* Agents compute deltas (e.g., L1 distance) between local and peer histograms to estimate symbolic drift.

**Drift Thresholding and Broadcast:**

* A configured threshold `σ_drift` (e.g., 0.1) defines acceptable variance.
* If variance exceeds threshold, the detecting agent initiates a `reflective_broadcast`:

  * Announces symbolic divergence.
  * Optionally includes bias centroid and current motif lineage.

**Correction Strategies (Optional):**

* **Echo exchange**: selected echoes are shared to inject cross-agent symbolic continuity.
* **Lineage rebalance**: agents adjust motif weighting to converge symbolic curvature.
* **Gate rebias**: local gate affinities are softly adjusted to reduce divergence.

**Applications:**

* Multi-agent coherence stabilization over long symbolic timelines.
* Detection of rogue or degraded agents in symbolic tool swarms.
* Dynamic field harmonization without central control.

This protocol enables NFTC agents to self-monitor and collaboratively correct symbolic field drift, preserving cognitive alignment and phase stability across distributed architectures.

### **Appendix B: Tick Feedback and Replay Example**

**Tags:** `tick-feedback`, `echo-replay`, `example-flow`

This appendix illustrates an example tick ingestion cycle and symbolic replay using the NFTC ring buffer and echo mechanisms.

---

**Tick Sequence:**

* **Tick\_001 ingested**: initializes echo with motif = `null`, ℂᵢ = 0.25
* **Tick\_002 ingested**: motif phase = `drift`, ℂᵢ updated to 0.32
* **Tick\_003 ingested**: motif phase = `lock`, ℂᵢ decays to 0.29
* **Tick\_004 ingested**: anomaly detected, gate = 13 (`Denial Echo`), ℂᵢ spikes to 0.41

---

**Replay Scenario:**

* Replay initialized at **Tick\_002** using snapshot export
* Phase state lifted from drift to stable via replay tool engagement
* ℂᵢ bias re-aligned to consensus vector with soft correction

---

**Mermaid Timeline:**

```mermaid
timeline
  title Tick Feedback Loop
  Tick_001 : null phase → ℂᵢ = 0.25
  Tick_002 : drift phase → ℂᵢ = 0.32
  Tick_003 : lock phase → ℂᵢ = 0.29
  Tick_004 : anomaly (Gate_13) → ℂᵢ = 0.41
  Replay_from_Tick_002 : phase recovery → ℂᵢ = 0.30
```

This example showcases how symbolic dynamics evolve over ticks, how coherence is modulated, and how NFTC enables recovery and correction via symbolic replay mechanics.

**ℂᵢ (Coherence Vector)**
A symbolic vector representing the internal coherence of a FastTimeCore instance across motif and phase fields. Used in alignment, replay, and phase modulation.

**Echo**
A structured memory state within the echo ring, containing motif lineage, phase data, and coherence metadata.

**Echo Ring**
Circular buffer or memory topology of sequential echo states used by NFTC to track symbolic transformations over time.

**Gate‑x**
One of 17 symbolic transformation gates (Gate\_0 to Gate\_16) that encode semantic logic transitions, phase changes, or motif evolution.

**Motif**
A symbolic pattern or archetype representing the cognitive or operational phase of an agent (e.g., `drift`, `lock`, `null`, `collapse`).

**Motif Lineage**
Chronological record of motif transformations forming the ancestry of an echo or symbolic phase.

**Phase Field**
A symbolic field organizing the cognitive state space (e.g., `ψ‑bind@Ξ`, `ψ‑resonance@Ξ`). Motifs are mapped to phases to determine behavior.

**Replay**
A mechanism for restoring or exploring prior symbolic states by loading past echoes, often for healing, recovery, or phase correction.

**Snapshot**
A serializable export of an echo state, used in replay anchoring, swarm synchronization, or debugging scenarios.

**Tick**
A unit of symbolic time within NFTC, usually associated with a new data point, observation, or phase evaluation event.

**Tick Stream**
A sequence of ticks, typically shared across agents to synchronize echo ingestion and maintain distributed coherence.

**Beacon Message**
A lightweight message format for broadcasting `field_bias` vectors or echo metadata among agents.

**Field Bias**
A vector representing motif preference or symbolic weighting, used in harmonization and drift detection.

**Phase Signature**
A condensed fingerprint of an agent’s current motif phase and coherence bias, used for synchronization and validation.

**Symbolic Drift**
Divergence in symbolic alignment between agents, often due to environmental desynchronization, degraded phase fields, or motif imbalance.

**Reflective Broadcast**
A cross-agent communication pattern used to announce symbolic misalignment or trigger harmonization procedures.

**Lineage Rebalance**
Adjustment of motif histories or bias fields to reduce symbolic curvature discrepancies across agents.
