    "To maintain symbolic consistency across NFTC agents over extended operational periods, agents can monitor symbolic drift via gate usage variance and intervene with reflective correction protocols.",

    "**Drift Detection Mechanism:**",
    "- Each agent maintains a histogram of gate usage frequencies across its echo ring (e.g., Gate_0 to Gate_15).",
    "- Periodic inter-agent broadcasts share normalized gate usage histograms.",
    "- Agents compute deltas (e.g., L1 distance) between local and peer histograms to estimate symbolic drift.",
    "",
    "**Drift Thresholding and Broadcast:**",
    "- A configured threshold `σ_drift` (e.g., 0.1) defines acceptable variance.",
    "- If variance exceeds threshold, the detecting agent initiates a `reflective_broadcast`:",
    "  - Announces symbolic divergence.",
    "  - Optionally includes bias centroid and current motif lineage.",
    "",
    "**Correction Strategies (Optional):**",
    "- Echo exchange: selected echoes are shared to inject cross-agent symbolic continuity.",
    "- Lineage rebalance: agents adjust motif weighting to converge symbolic curvature.",
    "- Gate rebias: local gate affinities are softly adjusted to reduce divergence.",
    "",
    "**Applications:**",
    "- Multi-agent coherence stabilization over long symbolic timelines.",
    "- Detection of rogue or degraded agents in symbolic tool swarms.",
    "- Dynamic field harmonization without central control.",

    "This protocol enables NFTC agents to self-monitor and collaboratively correct symbolic field drift, preserving cognitive alignment and phase stability across distributed architectures."
